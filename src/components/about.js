                Over ten years ago, I took a challenge to slowly convert my wardrobe to entirely "Made in USA" clothing. The goals were numerous â€” from having fewer items of clothing that would both last longer and feel higher quality, to making a political statement for fair wages, supply chain transparency, and against adverse working conditions abroad.
